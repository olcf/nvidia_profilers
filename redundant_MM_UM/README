redundant_MM

For each MPI rank, this program does the following:
  * Fill 2 NxN matrices with random numbers
  * Compute a matrix multiply on the CPU
  * Compute a matrix multiply on the GPU (loop_count times)
  * Compare the CPU and GPU results for consistency
  * Output the total runtime and time spent computing on the GPUs for each rank (and max)
    as well as the hardware thread and GPU used on a specific node

Environment Setup
-----------------
The following modules must be loaded to compile AND to run this program:
	essl
	cuda


Compiling
---------
After loading the modules mentioned above, just type `make`.


Running
-------
Two command line arguments must be supplied:
  N (matrix size)
  loop_count (number of times cublasDgemm is called)

For example, the following jsrun line will run 6 resource sets, each with 1 MPI rank, 1 physical core, and 1 GPU, with 3 resource sets per node:
(assuming you have requested at least two nodes via LSF)

  $ jsrun -n6 -c1 -g1 -a1 -r3 ./redundant_MM 2048 1000 | sort
  (N = 2048) Max Total Time: 6.879220 Max GPU Time: 2.816899
  Rank 000, HWThread 002, GPU 0, Node h41n09 - Total Time: 6.855115 GPU Time: 2.804994
  Rank 001, HWThread 004, GPU 1, Node h41n09 - Total Time: 6.816647 GPU Time: 2.814934
  Rank 002, HWThread 008, GPU 2, Node h41n09 - Total Time: 6.879220 GPU Time: 2.816899
  Rank 003, HWThread 000, GPU 0, Node h41n10 - Total Time: 5.862273 GPU Time: 2.814339
  Rank 004, HWThread 005, GPU 1, Node h41n10 - Total Time: 5.798143 GPU Time: 2.765094
  Rank 005, HWThread 010, GPU 2, Node h41n10 - Total Time: 5.746687 GPU Time: 2.785626


ADDITIONAL NOTES
----------------
If you want to target a common GPU from multiple MPI ranks, you need to enable MPS using the `-alloc_flags "gpumps"` LSF option.

----
TODO
----
* If GPU is not available to resource set (i.e. in jsrun command), the program will seg fault (This should be fixed with an in-code check).
